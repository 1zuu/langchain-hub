This prompt is a basic implementation of a question answering prompt for a map-reduce chain.
Specifically, it is the "reduce" prompt that gets applied documents after they have initially been asked for an answer.
It takes in a single variable for the initial responses (`summaries`) and then a variable for the question (`question`)
